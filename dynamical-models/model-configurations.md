# Model configurations
## NEMO based configurations
Model configurations used in projects are described in dedicated [meom-configuration repositoty](https://github.com/meom-configurations) on GitHub. 
Using the information found there, one should be able to reconstruct a particular configuration. However, as far as fortran compilers may evolve 
in time, the exact reproducibility is not granted.   
In the meom-configuration repository, the following information can be found for each configuration:
  * reference for building source code
  * relevant namelist files for running experiments
  * relevant xml files for XIOS model output
  * relevant information on the required input data files.
