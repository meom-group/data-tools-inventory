  <summary><strong>CRPS and RCRV scores, in the <a href="https://github.com/brankart/ensdam">EnsDAM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brankart/sesam">SeSAM</a> toolboxes.</strong></summary>

<hr style="border:1px solid blue">

This tool computes the CRPS and RCRV scores of a given ensemble from verification data.

The input is an ensemble of model states (in 1D, 2D, 3D or 4D) and a vector of verification data. The output is the CRPS or the RCRV score.

The score can be computed separately for different regions by providing a partition of the model states into regions.
