# Model diagnostics

## NEMO based configurations.
###  [DMONTOOLS](https://github.com/meom-group/DMONTOOLS)  (Drakkar MONitorin tool) 
It is used for providing a quick assesment of a NEMO based simulations. This package is build upon
more generic packages such as [CDFTOOLS](https://github.com/meom-group/CDFTOOLS) for diagnostic computation and [CHART_COUPE tool](https://github.com/meom-group/CHART_COUPE) for 
plotting specific maps and sections. This latter tools, based of NCAR graphics will not be maintained after JMM...    
The idea of `DMONTOOL` is to provide syntetic assesment of global indicators, based on annual or monthly average. For instance: 
  * time series of transports across specific sections, sea ice indicators (area/extent)
  * systematic mapping of some quantities, 
  * systematic plot of some sections, MOC ...

Plots resulting from this tool are available on a specific [meom monitoring web site](https://ige-meom-drakkar.u-ga.fr). *verif : actually down* The strenth of this tool is the capability of comparing various simulations using the same scales and same color palettes.

However, this very usefull package (as far as ocean modelisation is concerned) can/must be updated in order to produce better quality plot and web pages).
