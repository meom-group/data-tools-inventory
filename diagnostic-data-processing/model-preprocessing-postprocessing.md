# Model preprocessing and post processing tools
A very important part of the scientific and engineering work achieved in MEOM depends on these tools. 

## Around NEMO simulations.
### [CDFTOOLS](https://github.com/meom-group/CDFTOOLS):
This is a collection of Fortran programs aiming at performing off line diagnostics, using NEMO model configuration output. Some of the tools are also used for building NEMO
input files for a simulation.   
**CDFTOOLS** are coded following NEMO fortran coding rules and development of the tools involves many contributors from NEMO
community. Although the workflow is orchestrated by MEOM, it is clearly a collaborative work.  
**CDFTOOLS** is self documented: any of the programs in CDFTOOLS provides a usage message when executed without arguments.
